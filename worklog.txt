I found three ST folders. The first one in the 500GB HDD has 652 patient files, the second one in the STNDATA2/PATIENT DETAILS has 645 patient files and the last one in STNDATA2/DONE_ST has 642 patient files.

Comparing the 500GB HDD ST files with the 1TB STNDATA2/PATIENT DETAILS/ST, there have been (652-645 i.e 7 files) which are not in the 1TB STNDATA2/PATIENT DETAILS/ST. Six out of this files are not moved from the 500GB HDD ST files (because they were empty), the files are:
ST0721
ST0790
ST1461
ST1721
ST1725
ST1862
and a new file which is now in the 1TB STNDATA2/PATIENT DETAILS/ST, which is:
ST3455.
Comparing ST and DONE_ST in the 1TB HDD.
There are (645-642 i.e 3) files that are now in the ST_DONE file.
This particular patient file mix-up is a bit complicated so kindly take your time to read what's next.
I found two new files in DONE_ST that are not in ST. They are:
ST3066 - Fixed: Renaming issue.
ST3190 - It is an empty folder so it was ommitted.
And also, there were two files that are in DONE_ST that are not in ST. They are:
ST3174 -Fixed
ST3282 -Fixed

Renaming all the files in DONE_SNHSTAFFBS: Removing all the spaces: Instead of "ST. 0525 POPOOLA RONKE", it becomes "ST0525 POPOOLA RONKE".

All the files in the 1TB/Archive files needs to be renamed. E.g, 21123
Class RenFile.java and FileIter.java are breaking. Fixed

There are three empty files in 1TB/Archive, they are:
20520 NDABAI EDITH
23669 OJIGBO SAMMY J
34527 AKINOLA OLUSEYE O
I moved them all to EmptyArchives.
I found out that 34527 has another file there with the same name and having documents with the same name.

I moved 1TB/Archive files into ToDo for path reasons.
I want to rename all the files(1681) in Archive. -Done
When I was renaming, I found one ST file in there, which is:
ST820 Abass Mojisola
I moved the ST file to G:\STNDATA2\PATIENT DETAILS\ST.
N.B: The STFile ST820 needs to be edited.
All the Archive files needs to be edited

In the Active files, all the files there have been vouched to be OK(the info, my source). There exists two files that are ST files. I'll want to compare them both. 
Looking for files in DONE_ST that are in DONE_SNHSTAFFBS
ST3228. In the DONE_SNHSTAFFBS, it contains 10 pages of clerking sheet, and it's content was updated in the DONE_ST files to contain 11 pages of clerking sheet and from 3 pages of drug sheets to 4 pages of drug sheets. The lab wasn't updated.
I'm deleting the one in DONE_SNHSTAFFBS
Looking for files in DONE_SNHSTAFFBS that are in DONE_ST
No conflicting files were found
I'm comparing the contents of 1TB\STNDATA2\PATIENT DETAILS\DONE_ST with 1TB\Active files\DONE_ST.
ST3174 OLOMOFE CHARLES TOPE is not in 1TB:\Active files\DONE_ST. I've copied ST3174 to G:\Active files\DONE_ST. They both contain identical files now.

I want to compare the Archive files in 1TB with 1TB/STNDATA2/PATIENTDETAILS/ARCHIVE
Looking for Archive files in 1TB/STNDATA2/PATIENTDETAILS/ARCHIVE - None of it(i.e 1TB/Archive files were found in STNDATA2/PATIENTDETAILS/ARCHIVE)
Looking for 1TB/STNDATA2/PATIENTDETAILS/ARCHIVE in 1TB Archive files - None of it(i.e 1TB/STNDATA2/PATIENTDETAILS/ARCHIVE was found in 1TB/Archive files)
Looking for Archive files in 1TB/STNDATA2/PATIENTDETAILS/ARCHIVENIGHT - None of it was found
Looking for 1TB/STNDATA2/PATIENTDETAILS/ARCHIVENIGHT in Archive files - None of it was found

1TB/Archive is a very special case of files that needs to be edited on it's own as none of it's casenote was not found elsewhere. I think it was the Job that they did when I left for school.

I want to check if Elements/Previous Files/Contained is already in Active Files - No, it is not in Active files
I want to check if Elements/Previous Files/Contained is already in Archive - Yes, it's already in Archive and they need to be worked on.
